# Rest API Template
This is a template for a self-documented API using Express.js and Prisma. 

It is not prepared for production environment but feel free to modify it as much as you want.

## Important
At the time this was done, temporal was not released officially, so the [@js-temporal/polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-temporal/polyfill) was included. This is meant to be used **for experimental purposes only**. At the time you use check this, the [proposal-temporal repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) should be checked.
